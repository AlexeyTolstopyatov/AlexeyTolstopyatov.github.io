### General
This site is less about me and more about my work and research across various disciplines. Think of it as a personal compendium or an encyclopedia—a curated collection of experimentally verified findings and rescued documents that risk fading from the Web Archive. You'll find just one section here that's actually about me.

### About This Project
This site isn't a chronicle of my achievements. It's a growing archive of two kinds of material:
1. Historical documents and sources in danger of being lost.
2. Experimental data, whether verified or still under review.

All content is published in English and written by hand, based on original work and sourced references. My aim isn't just preservation—it's also clarification. I try to explain complex ideas in simpler terms than you might find in the original texts.

Many of the sources I reference are available in a dedicated [old documentation repository](https://github.com/AlexeyTolstopyatov/old-executables-documentation). If you'd rather skip my commentary and go straight to the sources, you're welcome to browse there!

### About Me
I'm a desktop developer and systems programming enthusiast, currently a university student with a background in art school and college. I don’t keep a formal portfolio.

I started coding in Visual Basic 6 back in elementary school. By middle school, I became curious about malware and low-level system design, which led me to Visual Basic .NET and eventually to C++ and C#. I used C# extensively throughout college, and .NET became a long-term home for me.

Since 2024, I’ve been setting myself increasingly ambitious—almost unreasonable—technical challenges, and I enjoy tackling them head-on.

As of 2025, my core stack includes `.NET Core/Framework`, `C#`, `F#`, `R`, `Rust`, `C`, `WinDbg`, and `SoftICE`. I also have experience with tools like TransW2000. I have basic knowledge of `C++`, `Java`, `Go`, and `Erlang`, but not enough to claim fluency. I’ve left `Visual Basic` behind entirely.

I’m drawn to well-forgotten technology that often reappears in modern forms. I work primarily on Microsoft Windows 11, and most of my research focuses on the Windows ecosystem.

A quick disclaimer: I sometimes use LLMs for proofreading and minor stylistic adjustments, since English is not my first language.
